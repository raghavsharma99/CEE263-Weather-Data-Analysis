This repo contains the files and code associated with the final project for CEE 263 Weather and Storms at Stanford University taught by Prof. Mark Jacobson. 
The project title is Data Analysis of Miami and Los Angeles Weathe (2010 - 2022) which is an exploratory data anlysis of daily historical
climate variables from 2010 - 2022 in Miami, FL and Los Angeles, CA. The project presents an analysis and visualization of Temperature, Precipitation, Wind Speed, and Wind Direction and digresses into analysing LA Air Quality and Miami Hurricanes.
